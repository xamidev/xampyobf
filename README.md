# Xami's Python Obfuscator

Obfuscates Python code.

### Usage

wip

### Methodology

First, the program looks at the file and strips any blank lines, comments, and such useless information: that's the minimizing step.
Then he compiles the Python code into bytecode which is still executable by computers but not quite human-readable. 

Further steps will be added to enhance the obfuscation process.

### To be done

- Python code minimizing
- Obfuscating the code
